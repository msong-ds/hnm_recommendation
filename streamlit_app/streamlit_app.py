'''
This visualization is inspired by a kaggle competition hosted by H&M.

The purposes of clustering are two.
First, it is to understand the dataset better and gain insights for further analysis.
Also, cluster information can be used as a feature when building a model.

9 clusters were identified using K-means clustering.



Customer segmentation is important in understanding and discovering new opportunities to improve the business metrics.

The dataset was originally provided by H&M.(put link).
I aggregated the dataset to represent the customers' shopping pattern.
The features of the new dataset are the number of items that each customer bought in each category.
I identified 9 clusters using K-means clustering.
For more details about the process, please refer to the clustering notebook in the repo.

Now let's take a look at the clusters in detail.

Each customer's transactions were aggregated into a dataset with 20 features. Each feature is the percentage of purchase in the feature category among the total purchase.

To visualize the clusters on 3D chart, the dimension was reduced into 3 using PCA.
Main clusters are formed around the vertices and in the middle of the pyramid.
The plot can be rotated and filtered.
