'''
This visualization is inspired by a [kaggle competition hosted by H&M](https://www.kaggle.com/c/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations).

The purposes of clustering are three. First, it is to understand the dataset better and gain insights for further analysis.
Second, cluster information can be used as a feature when building a model. Finally, clustering can be used to identify customer segments. 
Customer segmentation is important to understand and discover new opportunities to improve business metrics.

Nine clusters were identified using K-means clustering.

The dataset was originally provided by H&M, from which new features were generated to represent customers' shopping patterns and the dataset was aggregated by unique customer ID.
The new features are the number of items that each customer bought in each category. For more details about the process, please refer to the clustering notebook in the repository.

Now let's take a look at the clusters in detail.

'''
Each customer's transactions were aggregated into a dataset with 20 features. Each feature is the percentage of purchase in the respective category among the total purchase. For example, for the feature 'Women's every day collection' the values will represent the percentage of items a customer purchased in this category over the total number of items purchased. 

To visualize the clusters on a 3D chart, the dimensions were reduced from 20 to three using PCA. This graph shows that customer segments are distinctly clustered. In this three dimensions, the main clusters can be observed around the vertices and in the middle of the pyramid. For visualization and experimentation, the plot can be rotated and filtered.

             This study shows a clear segmentation of H&M's customers in nine clusters. Based on the results presented above and summarized in the table below, we make three suggestions:
             - Since most customers mostly purchase from a single category, further cross-selling efforts should be considered to increase customers' share of wallet and make H&M their one stop shop for clothing and accessories. Even the most infrequent H&M's customers purchase five times on average per year. Thus, there is great opportunity to increase the basket size in each of these purchases.
             - Given that customers in the biggest cluster purchase from Divided, Women's Everday Collection and Lingeries/Tights categories, an understanding of their demographics would allow for further expansion into other categories. For instance, is it adult women buying clothes for their teenage daughters? Adult women who also like the Divided category? Or teenage girls who wear Women's Everyday Collection?
             - The results of this study should be used to deepen the understanding of H&M's customers shopping behaviors. First, the clusters can be used as inputs for a model to predict shopping patterns and make recommendations. Second, coupled with interviews and surveys, the clusters can be improved with the definition of user personas and a better understanding of shopping decisions in each segment.
